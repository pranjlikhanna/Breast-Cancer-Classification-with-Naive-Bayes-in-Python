# Breast Cancer Classification with Naive Bayes in Python

## Project Description
This project involves the creation of a machine learning model using Python and Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign. Employing a Naive Bayes classifier, this model is trained on a comprehensive dataset to provide accurate predictions. The project emphasizes data preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation, demonstrating practical application in medical diagnostics.

## Features
# Data Preprocessing: 
Methods to clean and prepare the dataset for the machine learning model.
# Naive Bayes Implementation: 
Utilization of the Naive Bayes algorithm from Scikit-learn for classification.
# Model Evaluation: 
Techniques to assess the accuracy and performance of the classifier.
# Result Interpretation: 
Analyzing and understanding the outcomes of the model predictions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
1. Scikit-learn
2. Pandas
3. NumPy

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from a breast cancer database, containing features that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the model or extend the project are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
